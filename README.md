## What It Does

Perfumery is a React-based web application that provides:

- **Interactive Network Graph**: Visualize all 51 aromachemicals organized by scent family (citrus, floral, woody, musk, etc.) and note position (top, middle, base)
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find specific aromachemicals by name
- **Detailed Information Panel**: Click any node to view comprehensive details including:
  - Chemical structure and manufacturer
  - Scent description and origin story
  - Famous perfumes that use the ingredient
  - Substantivity (longevity), impact, and sillage characteristics
  - Pairing suggestions with other aromachemicals
  - IFRA limits and dilution recommendations
- **Visual Pairing Relationships**: See connections between aromachemicals that work well together
- **Color-Coded Families**: Each scent family has a distinct color for easy navigation

## Why Use This Tool

The visual approach makes it easy to understand the "architecture" of perfumery - how top notes (fleeting), middle notes (the heart), and base notes (long-lasting fixatives) work together, and how different scent families relate to each other.
