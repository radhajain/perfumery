# Perfumery - Interactive Aromachemical Explorer

An interactive visualization tool for exploring aromachemicals for perfumery. This project displays 51 essential perfume ingredients as an interactive network graph, allowing users to discover relationships between aromachemicals, their scent families, and how they pair together in existing fragrances.

## What It Does

Perfumery is a React-based web application that provides:

- **Interactive Network Graph**: Visualize all 51 aromachemicals organized by scent family (citrus, floral, woody, musk, etc.) and note position (top, middle, base)
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find specific aromachemicals by name
- **Detailed Information Panel**: Click any node to view comprehensive details including:
  - Chemical structure and manufacturer
  - Scent description and origin story
  - Famous perfumes that use the ingredient
  - Substantivity (longevity), impact, and sillage characteristics
  - Pairing suggestions with other aromachemicals
  - IFRA limits and dilution recommendations
- **Visual Pairing Relationships**: See connections between aromachemicals that work well together
- **Color-Coded Families**: Each scent family has a distinct color for easy navigation

## Why Use This Tool

The visual approach makes it easy to understand the "architecture" of perfumery - how top notes (fleeting), middle notes (the heart), and base notes (long-lasting fixatives) work together, and how different scent families relate to each other.
